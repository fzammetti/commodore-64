# Assembly

These are some old Commodore 64 Assembly code I wrote back in the 80's that I found on some old floppies. I don't represent any of this as being anything special - in fact, it all probably kinda sucks - but it's a piece of my history, so it's here.

These must be compiled with Gold Disk Assembler. To do so, load the assembler (which you can find here) ,8,1 and then load the source file and run it like a BASIC program. It will compile, and then you can execute the program with a SYS 49152 call.

As with all my old code, feel free to use and abuse it any way you wish, just toss a little credit my way if you do... but buyer beware: I provide no warranty for this code in any way, shape or form. Like I said, the intention is nothing but history.

Oh, and note that this was all written for NTSC machines, so it may or may not work right on PAL machines.  Hell, some of it may not work AT ALL.  Hey, it's roughly 40-year old code, what do you expect?!
